## Requirements

1. JDK >= 1.7 (if you run on 1.6 you will get an error on "\_cameras = new HashMap<>();")
2. With iOS 10 and higher you need to add the "Privacy - Camera Usage Description" key to the Info.plist of your project. This should be found in 'your_project/ios/your_project/Info.plist'. Add the following code:

```
<key>NSCameraUsageDescription</key>
<string>Your message to user when the camera is accessed for the first time</string>

<!-- Include this only if you are planning to use the camera roll -->
<key>NSPhotoLibraryUsageDescription</key>
<string>Your message to user when the photo library is accessed for the first time</string>

<!-- Include this only if you are planning to use the microphone for video recording -->
<key>NSMicrophoneUsageDescription</key>
<string>Your message to user when the microphone is accessed for the first time</string>
```

3. On Android, you require `buildToolsVersion` of `25.0.2+`. _This should easily and automatically be downloaded by Android Studio's SDK Manager._

4. On iOS 11 and later you need to add `NSPhotoLibraryAddUsageDescription` key to the Info.plist. This key lets you describe the reason your app seeks write-only access to the user’s photo library. Info.plist can be found in 'your_project/ios/your_project/Info.plist'. Add the following code:

```
<!-- Include this only if you are planning to use the camera roll -->
<key>NSPhotoLibraryAddUsageDescription</key>
<string>Your message to user when the photo library is accessed for the first time</string>
```

## Mostly automatic install with react-native

1. `npm install react-native-camera --save`
2. `react-native link react-native-camera`
   _To install it with Windows, see manual install below_

## Mostly automatic install with CocoaPods

1. `npm install react-native-camera --save`
2. Add the plugin dependency to your Podfile, pointing at the path where NPM installed it:

```obj-c
pod 'react-native-camera', path: '../node_modules/react-native-camera'
```

3. Run `pod install`

_Note:_ You might need to adjust your Podfile following the example below:

```ruby
target 'yourTargetName' do
  # See http://facebook.github.io/react-native/docs/integration-with-existing-apps.html#configuring-cocoapods-dependencies
  pod 'React', :path => '../node_modules/react-native', :subspecs => [
    'Core',
    'CxxBridge', # Include this for RN >= 0.47
    'DevSupport', # Include this to enable In-App Devmenu if RN >= 0.43
    'RCTText',
    'RCTNetwork',
    'RCTWebSocket', # Needed for debugging
    'RCTAnimation', # Needed for FlatList and animations running on native UI thread
    # Add any other subspecs you want to use in your project
  ]

  # Explicitly include Yoga if you are using RN >= 0.42.0
  pod 'yoga', :path => '../node_modules/react-native/ReactCommon/yoga'

  # Third party deps podspec link
  pod 'react-native-camera', path: '../node_modules/react-native-camera'

end

post_install do |installer|
  installer.pods_project.targets.each do |target|
    if target.name == "React"
      target.remove_from_project
    end
  end
end
```

## Manual install

## iOS

1. `npm install react-native-camera --save`
2. In XCode, in the project navigator, right click `Libraries` ➜ `Add Files to [your project's name]`
3. Go to `node_modules` ➜ `react-native-camera` and add `RNCamera.xcodeproj`
4. Expand the `RNCamera.xcodeproj` ➜ `Products` folder
5. In XCode, in the project navigator, select your project. Add `libRNCamera.a` to your project's `Build Phases` ➜ `Link Binary With Libraries`
6. Click `RNCamera.xcodeproj` in the project navigator and go the `Build Settings` tab. Make sure 'All' is toggled on (instead of 'Basic'). In the `Search Paths` section, look for `Header Search Paths` and make sure it contains both `$(SRCROOT)/../../react-native/React` and `$(SRCROOT)/../../../React` - mark both as `recursive`.

### Face Detection/Text Recognition/BarCode(using MLKit) Steps

Face Detection/Text Recognition/BarCode(using MLKit) are optional on iOS. If you want them, you will need to use CocoaPods path and set-up Firebase project for your app (detailed steps below).

_Note:_ Installing react-native-firebase package is NOT necessary.

### Modifying Podfile

Modify the dependency towards `react-native-camera` in your
`Podfile`, from

```
pod 'react-native-camera', path: '../node_modules/react-native-camera'
```

to (for Face Detection)

```
pod 'react-native-camera', path: '../node_modules/react-native-camera', subspecs: [
  'FaceDetectorMLKit'
]
```

or to (for Text Recognition)

```
pod 'react-native-camera', path: '../node_modules/react-native-camera', subspecs: [
  'TextDetector'
]
```

or to (for Barcode Recognition)

```
pod 'react-native-camera', path: '../node_modules/react-native-camera', subspecs: [
  'BarcodeDetectorMLKit'
]
```

or to (all possible detections)

```
pod 'react-native-camera', path: '../node_modules/react-native-camera', subspecs: [
  'TextDetector',
  'FaceDetectorMLKit',
  'BarcodeDetectorMLKit'
]
```

## Setting up Firebase

Text/Face recognition for iOS uses Firebase MLKit which requires setting up Firebase project for your app.
If you have not already added Firebase to your app, please follow the steps described in [getting started guide](https://firebase.google.com/docs/ios/setup).
In short, you would need to

1. Register your app in Firebase console.
2. Download `GoogleService-Info.plist` and add it to your project
3. Add `pod 'Firebase/Core'` to your podfile
4. In your `AppDelegate.m` file add the following lines:

```objective-c
#import <Firebase.h> // <--- add this
...

- (BOOL)application:(UIApplication *)application didFinishLaunchingWithOptions:(NSDictionary *)launchOptions
{
  [FIRApp configure]; // <--- add this
  ...
}
```

- If you have issues with duplicate symbols you will need to enable dead code stripping option in your Xcode (Target > Build Settings > search for "Dead code stripping") [see here](https://github.com/firebase/quickstart-ios/issues/487#issuecomment-415313053).
- If you are using `pod Firebase/Core` with a version set below 5.13 you might want to add `pod 'GoogleAppMeasurement', '~> 5.3.0'` to your podfile

### Android

1. `npm install react-native-camera --save`
2. Open up `android/app/src/main/java/[...]/MainApplication.java`

- Add `import org.reactnative.camera.RNCameraPackage;` to the imports at the top of the file
- Add `new RNCameraPackage()` to the list returned by the `getPackages()` method. Add a comma to the previous item if there's already something there.

3. Append the following lines to `android/settings.gradle`:

   ```gradle
   include ':react-native-camera'
   project(':react-native-camera').projectDir = new File(rootProject.projectDir, 	'../node_modules/react-native-camera/android')
   ```

4. Insert the following lines in `android/app/build.gradle`:

inside the dependencies block:

    ```gradle
    implementation project(':react-native-camera')
    ```

inside defaultConfig block insert either:

```gradle
android {
  ...
  defaultConfig {
    ...
    missingDimensionStrategy 'react-native-camera', 'general' <-- insert this line
  }
}
```

or, if using MLKit for text/face/barcode recognition:

```gradle
android {
  ...
  defaultConfig {
    ...
    missingDimensionStrategy 'react-native-camera', 'mlkit' <-- insert this line
  }
}
```

5. Declare the permissions in your Android Manifest (required for `video recording` feature)

```xml
<uses-permission android:name="android.permission.RECORD_AUDIO"/>
<uses-permission android:name="android.permission.CAMERA" />
<uses-permission android:name="android.permission.READ_EXTERNAL_STORAGE" />
<uses-permission android:name="android.permission.WRITE_EXTERNAL_STORAGE" />
```

6. Add jitpack to android/build.gradle

```gradle
allprojects {
    repositories {
        maven { url "https://www.jitpack.io" }
        maven { url "https://maven.google.com" }
    }
}
```

7. Additional steps for using MLKit for text/face/barcode recognition

   7.1. Using Firebase MLKit requires seting up Firebase project for your app. If you have not already added Firebase to your app, please follow the steps described in [getting started guide](https://firebase.google.com/docs/android/setup).
   In short, you would need to

   - Register your app in Firebase console.
   - Download google-services.json and place it in `android/app/`
   - add the folowing to project level build.gradle:

   ```gradle
       buildscript {
         dependencies {
         // Add this line
         classpath 'com.google.gms:google-services:4.0.1' <-- you might want to use different version
         }
       }
   ```

   - add to the bottom of `android/app/build.gradle` file

   ```gradle
   apply plugin: 'com.google.gms.google-services'
   ```

   7.2. Configure your app to automatically download the ML model to the device after your app is installed from the Play Store. If you do not enable install-time model downloads, the model will be downloaded the first time you run the on-device detector. Requests you make before the download has completed will produce no results.

   ```xml
   <application ...>
   ...
     <meta-data
         android:name="com.google.firebase.ml.vision.DEPENDENCIES"
         android:value="ocr" />
     <!-- To use multiple models, list all needed models: android:value="ocr, face, barcode" -->
   </application>
   ```

The current Android library defaults to the below values for the Google SDK and Libraries,

```gradle
def DEFAULT_COMPILE_SDK_VERSION             = 26
def DEFAULT_BUILD_TOOLS_VERSION             = "26.0.2"
def DEFAULT_TARGET_SDK_VERSION              = 26
def DEFAULT_GOOGLE_PLAY_SERVICES_VERSION    = "12.0.1"
def DEFAULT_SUPPORT_LIBRARY_VERSION         = "27.1.0"
```

You can override this settings by adding a Project-wide gradle configuration properties for
use by all modules in your ReactNative project by adding the below to `android/build.gradle`
file,

```gradle
buildscript {...}

allprojects {...}

/**
* Project-wide gradle configuration properties for use by all modules
*/
ext {
    compileSdkVersion           = 26
    targetSdkVersion            = 26
    buildToolsVersion           = "26.0.2"
    googlePlayServicesVersion   = "12.0.1"
    googlePlayServicesVisionVersion = "15.0.2"
    supportLibVersion           = "27.1.0"
}
```

The above settings in the ReactNative project over-rides the values present in the `react-native-camera`
module. For your reference below is the `android/build.gradle` file of the module.

```gradle
def safeExtGet(prop, fallback) {
    rootProject.ext.has(prop) ? rootProject.ext.get(prop) : fallback
}

buildscript {
  repositories {
    google()
    maven {
      url 'https://maven.google.com'
    }
    jcenter()
  }

  dependencies {
    classpath 'com.android.tools.build:gradle:3.3.1'
  }
}

apply plugin: 'com.android.library'

android {
  compileSdkVersion safeExtGet('compileSdkVersion', 28)
  buildToolsVersion safeExtGet('buildToolsVersion', '28.0.3')

  defaultConfig {
    minSdkVersion safeExtGet('minSdkVersion', 16)
    targetSdkVersion safeExtGet('targetSdkVersion', 28)
  }

  flavorDimensions "react-native-camera"

  productFlavors {
    general {
      dimension "react-native-camera"
    }
    mlkit {
      dimension "react-native-camera"
    }
  }

  sourceSets {
    main {
      java.srcDirs = ['src/main/java']
    }
    general {
      java.srcDirs = ['src/general/java']
    }
    mlkit {
      java.srcDirs = ['src/mlkit/java']
    }
  }

  lintOptions {
    abortOnError false
    warning 'InvalidPackage'
  }
}

repositories {
  google()
  jcenter()
  maven {
   url 'https://maven.google.com'
  }
  maven { url "https://jitpack.io" }
  maven {
    // All of React Native (JS, Obj-C sources, Android binaries) is installed from npm
    url "$rootDir/../node_modules/react-native/android"
  }
}

dependencies {
  def googlePlayServicesVisionVersion = safeExtGet('googlePlayServicesVisionVersion', safeExtGet('googlePlayServicesVersion', '17.0.2'))

  implementation 'com.facebook.react:react-native:+'
  implementation "com.google.zxing:core:3.3.3"
  implementation "com.drewnoakes:metadata-extractor:2.11.0"
  generalImplementation "com.google.android.gms:play-services-vision:$googlePlayServicesVisionVersion"
  implementation "com.android.support:exifinterface:${safeExtGet('supportLibVersion', '28.0.0')}"
  implementation "com.android.support:support-annotations:${safeExtGet('supportLibVersion', '28.0.0')}"
  implementation "com.android.support:support-v4:${safeExtGet('supportLibVersion', '28.0.0')}"
  mlkitImplementation "com.google.firebase:firebase-ml-vision:${safeExtGet('firebase-ml-vision', '19.0.3')}"
  mlkitImplementation "com.google.firebase:firebase-ml-vision-face-model:${safeExtGet('firebase-ml-vision-face-model', '17.0.2')}"
}
```

If you are using a version of `googlePlayServicesVersion` that does not have `play-services-vision`, you can specify a different version of `play-services-vision` by adding `googlePlayServicesVisionVersion` to the project-wide properties

```
ext {
    compileSdkVersion           = 26
    targetSdkVersion            = 26
    buildToolsVersion           = "26.0.2"
    googlePlayServicesVersion   = "16.0.1"
    googlePlayServicesVisionVersion = "15.0.2"
    supportLibVersion           = "27.1.0"
}
```

### Windows

1. `npm install react-native-camera --save`
2. Link the library as described here: [react-native-windows / LinkingLibrariesWindows.md](https://github.com/microsoft/react-native-windows/blob/master/current/docs/LinkingLibrariesWindows.md)
   For the last step of this guide, you have to add the following things to your `MainReactNativeHost.cs`:

- in the import section at the very top: `using RNCamera;`
- in `protected override List<IReactPackage> Packages => new List<IReactPackage>` add a new line with `new RNCameraPackage()`

3. Add the capabilities (permissions) for the webcam and microphone as described here: [docs.microsoft / audio-video-camera](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/uwp/audio-video-camera/simple-camera-preview-access#add-capability-declarations-to-the-app-manifest)
4. Use `RCTCamera` (RNCamera is not supported yet) like described above

Follow the [Q & A](QA.md) section if you are having compilation issues.
